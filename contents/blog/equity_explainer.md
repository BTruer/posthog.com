# A complete and simple guide to options at PostHog

Suppose you’ve ever worked for a start-up, or read news about a Unicorn tech company turning people into multi-millionaires overnight. In that case, chances are you have heard of the concept of equity.

Equity is the amount of ownership of a corporation held by a person or entity. This ownership is usually described as either a percentage of the total equity of the business or at later stages, a finite number of shares. The majority of tech start-ups offer equity as part of their total compensation, normally in the form of share “options”. The upside potential of these options is meant to compensate for the more gruelling (and in my opinion, rewarding) work of growing a start-up company from founding to IPO (more on that later).

Despite its popularity, equity is very rarely understood by employees! With this post, I hope to shine a light on some of the most confusing aspects of start-up equity, and highlight how PostHog breaks from the norm to offer options in a much more employee-friendly way.

When a start-up company is incorporated, the founders decide on how to divide ownership of the company between them by quite literally choosing a random number of shares to create out of thin air and distribute to each other in some proportion. In the common two-founder model, most start-ups distribute the shares as a 50/50 split between them, accounting for 100% ownership of the business. The shares are "purchased" for a nominal cost like a ten-thousandth of a cent because the value of a newly minted start-up company is effectively nothing.

As our hypothetical founders pull Red-Bull-fueled all-nighters building their MVP and applying to accelerator programs, the valuation of their company slowly increases until the point where they seek outside investors to inject capital into the business to expedite growth. In exchange for that investment, the founders must give investors ownership in the business but rather than giving away their own shares, they authorize a new number of shares to be created and exchanged for real dollars. In doing so, they “dilute” their ownership by increasing the size of the total equity pie, without growing their own number of shares. This process of dilution will continue with every new fundraising round, impacting the value of a given person’s equity as well as the founders’ authority over the business relative to their investors.

Usually, the first fundraising round (AKA the ‘seed’ round) will involve carving out a chunk of the newly generated shares to create an ‘options pool’, which can be dipped into to provide options to newly hired employees as the company grows in size. 

### But what exactly is an option? 

It's an option to purchase a share of the company at a given price –the “strike price”– which is known as “exercising” the option, thus becoming a percent owner of the company. However, these options are almost always granted by way of what is known as a vesting schedule, where options become available for exercise progressively over the course of employment with the company. This is to prevent a new hire from joining a company, exercising all of their options immediately, quitting, and watching their shares in the company grow in value without contributing any work towards building the company. 

The most common vesting schedule for tech companies these days is the 4-year/1-year cliff, which means that a quarter of your options vest after your 1-year work anniversary, and 1/36th of your remaining options vest each month for the following three years. As a company, we feel that this structure strikes a fair balance between incentivizing team members to stay and contribute to the growth of the company, while not locking them into “golden handcuffs” where they are required to put in 4 years of work to reap any of the benefits of being a part of a start-up.

### But how exactly do share options turn you into a millionaire? 

When you are granted your options on the first day of employment, the price you will pay to exercise them will stay static at whatever the Fair Market Value (FMV) per share is on your first day, irrespective of what the value is when you sell your purchased shares. The FMV is decided through an external, very complicated process known as a 409A, and the initial sale price of the share is usually set when the company “goes public” or “IPOs” by being listed on a public stock exchange like the NYSE. This is known as a “liquidation event” and in the simplest terms, the difference between your exercise price and the price of the share you sell in the public market is cash in your pocket. The reality of this is much more complicated, as there can be a number of [tax implications](https://secfi.com/learn/exercise-stock-options-tax-implications) depending on the type of option you were granted, when you decide to exercise them relative to when you sell them, and your overall income; but you really should talk to an accountant before making any serious decisions so you don’t end up with an unexpectedly massive tax bill.

Making matters more complicated, the majority of standard terms in stock option plans limit your freedom in when and how you can exercise your options. 

### At PostHog, we try to do things differently:

|                           | **PostHog**                 | **The Other Guys**           |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Vesting Start:**        | On your first day           | After a "probationary period" |
| **Exercise Window:**      | 10 _years_ after departure  | 90 _days_ after departure    |
| **Merger or Acquisition** | Double-Trigger acceleration | No acceleration              |

### Vesting Start:

At PostHog, we recognize that you start contributing to the company on day 1, so we feel that you should start earning your options on that day as well. Many others make you wait until after a probationary period, often 3-months, before your options start to vest.

### Exercise Window:

Regardless of whether you resign, or are let go for performance reasons, you will have 10 years from the day you were hired to exercise your options. In most companies, you have only 3 months to exercise your options before you lose them entirely, which can make tax optimization and planning a stressful and difficult process.

In the unlikely event that you are let go “with cause” (AKA gross misconduct like embezzlement or discrimination), you will forfeit your options, which we feel is only fair.

### What if the company gets sold?

In the event that PostHog is sold to another company before we reach an IPO, we have preferable terms that ensure team members who contributed to growing the company to that point are rewarded for their efforts. If the company is acquired (first trigger) AND you are terminated as part of that acquisition (second trigger), all of your options vest immediately and your 10-year window to exercise them begins. This can offer some protection and certainty to employees who exercise their options following this trigger, as shares in the company during acquisition are much more tangible than options to buy shares, and are often converted into shares of the acquiring company or bought back by the acquirer for cash.

As an open-source company, we are transparent about compensation including equity, because we believe that everyone who contributes to our success should reap the benefits. For more information about how PostHog thinks about equity, check out our compensation page and equity FAQ in our handbook.
