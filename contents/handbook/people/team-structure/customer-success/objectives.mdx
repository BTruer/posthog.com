* **Proposed Objective:**
    * Scale Customer Success through automation
* **Proposed Key Results:**
    * Finish Q4 with 24 more customers in the $20-100k ARR range than we started.
    * Don't churn any customer who has paid one invoice in the $20k-100k ARR range.
    * We can easily report on a customer's adoption and react according to where they are on the journey to provide maximum benefit.
* **Rationale:**
    * We have learned a lot from selling this year and now itâ€™s time to scale
    * We are getting more and more signups each week.
    * We need to improve conversion. Being more effective will come from automation.
